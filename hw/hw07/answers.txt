Homework 2

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296

GC-content: 0.45105133333333336

sample 4

sample 5

sample 6
GC-content: 0.4915185185185185


Problem 3:

Program failed to run.  Error was given stating 'linenum' is not defined. Adding the comment removed the variable set to 0, so the following code in the for loop 'linenum' was not defined.
If gc_count = 0 is removed the same thing as before when linenum was remoed. The following for loop would not be able to set the count of gc and would not know what it was referring to. Giving out an error saying gc_count is not defined.

Problem 4:

AT-content: 0.5689938518518518


Problem 5:

A-content: 0.2852328518518519
C-content: 0.21774548148148148
G-content: 0.21254714814814815
T-content: 0.283761

Problem 6:

For all files except the test file, the total_count variable (total number of nucleotides) and length of the sequence variable had matching totals while the sum of ACGT counts differed. 

After taking a look into one of the files, it looks like the sum of ACGT nucleotides differ from the sequence length and total count because there are  nucleotides other than A, C, G, and T in the sequence.  This is why there is a variance in the totals.

To compute the GC content, only the sum of A,C,G,T nucleotides should be used.  The other two cannot because there might be other nucleotides in the sequence so sequence length and total count should ne be used in gc content calculation since the formula is (G+C)/(A+C+G+T)).

Also my program incorrectly computed the GC content since the program used total count of nucleotides as the denominator in calculations.

Problem 7:

AT/GC ratio: 1.3223416174746196

Problem 8:

GC-content: 0.43059987061138255
GC Class: moderate GC content

Collaboration:

I did not collaborate with anyone. Did not run into too many complications in doing the assignment. Used google for some errors that I did run into.

Reflection:

This assignment helped me in looking over code and to double check outputs.  I learned about floats.
