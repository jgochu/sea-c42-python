### About Me

My name is John and I currently live in Seattle. I have been in Seattle for the last 5 years and pretty much
grew up in the state of Washington. I enjoy hiking and camping when I have time to get out.
Other hobbies I enjoy are playing tennis and fish keeping. I would like to be able to travel around the
world some more and hoping to plan a trip to Japan next year.


I hope that by taking codefellow classes I will be able to land a new career where I can achieve some of
my goals and to pursue some of my passions. I want to be able to take the next steps in my life
and see this as opportunity to start that process. I want to be able to learn Python and build skills 
necessary to succeed as a programmer.
